# QOCA
 Code for the QOCA variational form and the Fermi-Hubbard model

This was developed using the following version of Qiskit:
qiskit-aer                    0.6.0
qiskit-aqua                   0.7.0
qiskit-ibmq-provider          0.6.0
qiskit-ignis                  0.4.0
qiskit-terra                  0.14.0
But, it should also work with more recent versions.
One could even update the code incorporating the newest features of Qiskit.
