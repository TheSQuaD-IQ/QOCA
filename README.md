# QOCA
 Code for the QOCA variational form and the Fermi-Hubbard model

This was developed using the following version of Qiskit:
{'qiskit-terra': '0.11.1',
 'qiskit-aer': '0.3.4',
 'qiskit-ignis': '0.2.0',
 'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.4.5',
 'qiskit-aqua': '0.6.2',
 'qiskit': '0.14.1'}
But, it should also work with more recent versions.
One could even update the code incorporating the newest features of Qiskit.
